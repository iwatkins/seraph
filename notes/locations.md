## Bilgerat Inn

specifically adapted to suit customers from smaller races

- the Bilgerat gang. Owners of the Bilgerat inn, near the port district. They are mostly informants for Aramis. In exchange for protection they keep an ear out in their inn for anything that would be interesting for the "Rat king" to know. Apart from this they're harmless and actually pretty pleasant company. (members are Thierry Bilge and Felix Foxtrot as well as any temporary staff they have at the moment)
