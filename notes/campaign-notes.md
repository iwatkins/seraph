## On the Triarchy:

In short, there's a triarch who rules entertainment (both legal and illegal) a triarch who operates in the slums and is similar to the ironmongers (petty crime, paying for "protection" burglary, robbery) and a triarch who operates in the highest circles and.mostly deals with blackmail and corruption. He also seems to have the best ties with pirates that brokered a deal with the Nidoran government 
The first and 3rd triarch work in close proximity, the 2nd is more included because they want to keep tabs on him in case he'd cause trouble 
A lot of smaller sub-sections pay tribute and are loyal to one or more triarchs

### Aramis

on the triarch in the slums: He is known as Aramis or "the rat king" he's a mysterious fellow who seems to have appeared out of nowhere. He was either a smalltime criminal from the slums itself who worked his way up, or someone from the inner city who wanted to avoid direct competition with the very dangerous triarchs (before the triarchy was a thing). He has his headquarters in the "old nightingale inn". He isn't very active himself but has a lot of hirelings to force the criminals on his turf to pay tribute in exchange for his "support and protection" 

### Criminals connected to Aramis:

"The baron". Nominally connected to the "Ringmaster" (triarch ruling entertainment) due to mostly travelling around poorer areas he's managed to get into the orbit of the "rat king" as well. He owns a circus that travels around the Golden Coast to do all sorts of crime (including violent crimes), when back home in Nidoras he pays tribute to the "Ringmaster" and provides his goons as muscle to the to avoid a 2nd tribute. Despite the entertainment the circus provides its members are some of the most ruthless individuals found in the Nidoran underworld,
 
- the Bilgerat gang. Owners of the Bilgerat inn, near the port district. They are mostly informants for Aramis. In exchange for protection they keep an ear out in their inn for anything that would be interesting for the "Rat king" to know. Apart from this they're harmless and actually pretty pleasant company. (members are Thierry Bilge and Felix Foxtrot as well as any temporary staff they have at the moment)

- The overseer: a corrupt guard captain who provides false legitimacy for people and goods needing to get smuggled in and out of the city. Mostly the slums are in his pocket so his influence in the inner city is limited.,
 
- The syndicate: A band of lower class citizens who have banded together to try and better the circumstances in the slums by whatever means necessary. They are spread all over the slums and lower class districts of the city in any profession, working closely together so their under the counter trades, forgeries, smuggling and selling of goods that aren't up to standards is almost impossible to tie to a specific person or party.

- company of the Ridge. A band of criminals who go around the slums picking up the drunk and desperate to travel around and work for dirt-cheap wages around the bay of Nidoras. (They are owned and funded by someone known as "Iron Alner")
