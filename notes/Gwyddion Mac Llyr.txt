Gwyddion Mac Llyr
Faerie Rogue - Arcane Trickster

The Mac Llyr clan were wanderers—true feybloods cut off from the Feywild when the great rift sealed it shut. They clung to customs, music, and rituals like lifelines, living on the edges of cities and courts, never truly welcome. Think colorfully patched tents just outside the “civilized” walls, storytelling under threadbare stars, a fire always smoldering, never roaring.

His mother told fortunes (mostly lies), his uncle fenced stolen goods, and his older siblings ran scams that ranged from clever to pathetic. Gwyddion grew up hungry: for food, respect, and a place he didn't have to leave at dawn.

He learned thieving as necessity, not art—though he made it one. He had fingers like whispers and feet like smoke. Eventually, he ran jobs alone. Cleaner that way. Safer. Or so he thought.

The Triarchy set Gwyddion up with a job in Nidoras to swipe an "innocent" ledger from a boarded-up apothecary - just family accounts, the contact said. He slipped in, snagged the humming leather book, and left it at the dead drop. No pay came.  Two days later, a rough sketch of him was trading hands in every tavern alley and the contact disappeared.  They may not know his name, but they knew his face.  He left Nidoras behind to lay low until it blows over.  In search of work and safety, Gwyddion has made his way to a new town...
