# The Party

## Gwyddion Mac Llyr

![Gwyddion Mac Llyr](<images/characters/Gwyddion.png> =200x)

The [Mac Llyr clan](#mac-llyr-clan) were wanderers—true feybloods cut off from the Feywild when the great rift sealed it shut. They clung to customs, music, and rituals like lifelines, living on the edges of cities and courts, never truly welcome. Think colorfully patched tents just outside the “civilized” walls, storytelling under threadbare stars, a fire always smoldering, never roaring.

His mother told fortunes (mostly lies), his uncle fenced stolen goods, and his older siblings ran scams that ranged from clever to pathetic. Gwyddion grew up hungry: for food, respect, and a place he didn't have to leave at dawn.

He learned thieving as necessity, not art—though he made it one. He had fingers like whispers and feet like smoke. Eventually, he ran jobs alone. Cleaner that way. Safer. Or so he thought.

The Triarchy set Gwyddion up with a job in Nidoras to swipe an "innocent" ledger from a boarded-up apothecary owned (but not operated) by Lady Morgan of Bayleth - just family accounts, the contact said. He slipped in, snagged the humming leather book, and left it at the dead drop.  No pay came.  Two days later, a rough sketch of him was trading hands in every tavern alley and the contact disappeared.  They may not know his name, but they knew his face.  He left Nidoras behind to lay low until it blows over.  In search of work and safety, Gwyddion has made his way to a new town...

# Mac Llyr Clan

The Mac Llyr clan were wanderers—true feybloods cut off from the Feywild when the great rift sealed it shut. They clung to customs, music, and rituals like lifelines, living on the edges of cities and courts, never truly welcome. Think colorfully patched tents just outside the “civilized” walls, storytelling under threadbare stars, a fire always smoldering, never roaring.

The Mac Llyr clan roams around the coast, but frequently returns to Nidoras - where they've been encamped for the past five years.

## Lady Aledaleon

![Lady Aladeleon](<images/characters/Lady-Aledaleon.png> =200x)

Lady Aladeleon is the mother of Gwyddion and Astor.  She serves as a fortune teller (mostly lies) to travellers.  She can be found cooking for other members of the camp, stews, soups, and sweet treats for all.

## Astor Mac Llyr

![Astor Mac Llyr](<images/characters/Astor-mac-llyr.png> =200x)

Gwyddion's brother, an entertainer, and reveller. Gwyddion always been better than this family member at pranking.  Astor grew jealous and abandoned Gwyddion, so that they could return and best me one day.

## Uncle Ewythr Mac Llyr

![Uncle Ewyther](<images/characters/uncle-ewythr.png> =200x)

A fence and smuggler of ill-repute.

> "Folks, I may or may not have stepped on some toes in the city, but not to worry, it's all bein' ironed out"

Those words would announce nothing but trouble for the Mac Llyrs in the coming years.  It was Ewythr that would get Aramis the Rat King's attention and entwine them with the Triarchy.

## Cogwyr Mac Llyr

![Cogwyr Mac Llyr](<images/characters/cogwyr-mac-llyr.png> =200x)

Ewythr's daugher and Gwyddion's cousin.
She's pretty sarcastic, often having biting remarks regarding her father's antics, but is a kleptomaniac so a good amount of his goods were provided by her.

# The Fey

## Granny Ealswyth

![Granny Ealswyth](<images/characters/Granny-Ealswyth.png> =200x)

Despite her horrific appearance this ancient hag is good-natured and is like a caring grandmother to the community. The camp looks and feels like the feywild thanks to her magic and influence, but only as long as she is there. Because of this she only leaves when the entire camp moves to a new location. She enjoys sitting around the fire and telling tales from long lost ages and their forgotten homeland to the children in the camp.

## Gullie and Gowrie

![Gullie and Gowriew](<images/characters/Gullie_and_Gowrie.png> =200x)

The redcap twins: the twin redcaps Gullie and Gowrie are under no circumstance allowed to leave the camp, tho they often try and sometimes succeed. What they consider harmless pranks are serious issues for a city and outright disasters for a small town. Granny Ealswyth keeps a close eye on them as often as she can.

## Lyndhe

![Lyndhe](<images/characters/Lyndhe.png> =200x)

Lyndhe 150y/o dryad. This dryad's tree was cut down a century ago, meaning she would perish if she didn't return to the feywild (which had become impossible when the connection was lost centuries before) Granny Ealswyth took her in and with the magic maintaining the feywild nature of the camp, Lyndhe too can survive. She often enjoys sitting around the campfire hearing stories of those who can leave the campsite. Afterwise she paints beautiful paintings of places she'll never visit and people she'll never meet.

## Buttercup

![Buttercup](<images/characters/Buttercup.png> =200x)

Buttercup: 42 y/o satyr. Buttercup is more often than not on the road, travelling far and wide. However at least once a year he returns to camp for the Yuletide bringing gifts and tales from all corners of the world.

# Triarchy

## Angela Hawthorne

![Angela Hawthorne](<images/characters/Angela-Hawythorne.png> =200x)

Angela Hawthorne would be your criminal contact in Nidoras

When she's not in the "Old nightingale" she can be found in the "Bilgerat Inn" as it's specifically adapted to suit customers from smaller races.
she's a high ranking member under Aramis and is the one who gathers information and decides what that information is worth.
